his repository contains advanced AWS cloud architecture projects that demonstrate real-world implementation of secure, scalable, and production-ready infrastructure. The projects focus on integrating multiple AWS services to simulate enterprise-level cloud environments, covering access control, networking, automation, monitoring, containerization, and secure secret management.

The implementation begins with role-based access control by attaching IAM roles to EC2 instances, enabling secure access to AWS resources without storing credentials. Storage monitoring is implemented using Amazon S3 integrated with CloudWatch metrics and alarms to track usage and trigger alerts. Event-driven architecture is demonstrated by connecting S3 with AWS Lambda, where file uploads automatically trigger serverless functions for processing tasks such as image resizing or metadata logging.

Advanced networking concepts are applied by designing a custom VPC with public and private subnets, deploying EC2 instances in private networks, and configuring bastion host access for secure connectivity. Domain management is handled through Route 53 by mapping hosted zones to EC2 web servers. Secure database access is implemented using Amazon RDS with IAM authentication to eliminate hardcoded passwords. Messaging architecture is built using SNS and SQS to enable reliable and decoupled communication between services.

Automation and operational resilience are further enhanced using CloudWatch alarms integrated with Lambda functions to automatically stop or reboot EC2 instances during high CPU utilization. Containerized deployment is implemented using Amazon ECS, where applications store persistent data in S3. Sensitive credentials are securely managed using AWS Secrets Manager and retrieved dynamically by Lambda functions.
